# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This is a very simple backend for a fake store that I made so that I could learn more about how to make changes to a database and pull information from a database.
I learned that you need to set up your endpoints correctly because the smallest error will make it so that endpoint doesn't work.

## Installation

You just need to clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage

the first thing that you need to do is to run "npm install" to get the necessary packages and then make a .env file to store the variables for your MYSQL stuff
(database name, user, and password). The next thing that you are going to want to do is to run "npm seed" to make sure that the database is working right.
